Welcome to the Bellabeat Data Analytics Case Study repository! In this project, we will be conducting open source data analysis on other well-being smart devices in order to gain insights and apply them to the company's goals for future growth. The stakeholders of Bellabeat hope that these insights will be used to inform future marketing decisions and shape the direction of the company in order to capture a larger share of the market.
